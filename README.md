A Django web application that keeps you up to date on what's going on in your area. From handyman contact information to meeting notifications and even warnings, there's something for everyone.

## Overall Description
## Project perspective
If you are like me, you really don't know what is happening in your neighborhood most of the time. What if an important meeting happens, theft or even death wouldn't you like to know about it.
Your task is to design a web application that keeps you informed about what's going on in your neighborhood. From handyman contact information to meeting notifications and even warnings.

As a user I would like too:
1. Sign in with the application to start using.
2. Set up a profile about me and a general location and my neighborhood name.
3. Find a list of different businesses in my neighborhood.
4. Find contact information for the health department and police authorities near my neighborhood.
5. Create Posts that will be visible to everyone in my neighborhood.
6. change my neighborhood when I decide to move out.
